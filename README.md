# Time Details and Changelist
Time taken: ~5h 30m

- Created generic "Button.h" base class, capable of performing custom functionality when pressed.
- Expanded on "Button.h" class with two button classes, "ControlsButton.h" and "ChangeGamestateButton.h", both of which perform different functionality.
- Created "ButtonManager.h" class, capable of rendering and updating all buttons added.
- Created two classes, "PauseMenu.h" and "StartMenu.h", to allow for a start and pause menu in game.
- Created "InputManager.h" class, to allow the user to swap between keyboard and mouse controls.
- Fixed bug where PowerupBase had included it's child class as a header file, causing child class to not be able to inherit from PowerupBase due to it being undefined at that time.
